High Priority / Blockers for v1.0;

* serial server-side listener/dispatcher.  This will allows the
  source VM name to be known and passed as part of the fencing
  request to the appropriate backend.

* pacemaker backend

* ability to pass the hostname, VM name, or VM UUID of the requesting
  node to the backend.  This will allow better controls of who can
  fence who (for example, "vm1 vm2 vm3" can all fence each other, while
  none may fence "vm4 vm5 vm6" since they are in a different cluster).

* libvirt-qpid security model: mirror what is done in libvirt-qpid
  for authentication.

* hostlist functionality (partially done)

* metadata function

Future Stuff:

* oVirt backend

* libccs configuration plugin

* clean up development bits so third parties can develop plugins
