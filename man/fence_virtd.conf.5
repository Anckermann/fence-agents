.TH fence_virtd.conf 5

.SH NAME
fence_virtd.conf - configuration file for fence_virtd

.SH DESCRIPTION

The fence_virtd.conf file contains configuration information for fence_virtd,
a fencing request routing daemon for clusters of virtual machines.

The file is tree-structured.  There are parent/child relationships and sibling
relationships between the nodes.

  foo {
    bar {
      baz = "1";
    }
  }

There are three primary sections of fence_virtd.conf.

.SH SECTIONS
.SS fence_virtd

This section contains global information about how fence_virtd is to operate.
The most important pieces of information are as follows:

.TP
.B listener
.
the listener plugin for receiving fencing requests from clients

.TP
.B backend
.
the plugin to be used to carry out fencing requests

.SS listeners

This section contains listener-specific configuration information; see the
section about listeners below.

.SS backends

This section contains listener-specific configuration information; see the
section about listeners below.

.SH LISTENERS

There are various listeners available for fence_virtd, each one handles
decoding and authentication of a given fencing request.  The following 
configuration blocks belong in the \fBlisteners\fP section of fence_virtd.conf

.SS multicast
.TP
.B key_file
.
the shared key file to use (default: /etc/cluster/fence_xvm.key).

.TP
.B hash
.
the hashing algorithm to use for packet signing (default: sha256, but could
be sha1, sha512, or none)

.TP
.B auth
.
the hashing algorithm to use for the simplistic challenge-response authentication
(default: sha256, but could be sha1, sha512, or none)

.TP
.B family
.
the IP family to use (default: ipv4, but may be ipv6)

.TP
.B address
.
the multicast address to listen on (default: 225.0.0.12)

.TP
.B port
.
the multicast port to listen on (default: 1229)

.TP
.B interface
.
interface to listen on.  By default, fence_virtd listens on all interfaces.
However, this causes problems in some environments where the host computer
is used as a gateway.


.SH BACKENDS

There are various backends available for fence_virtd, each one handles
routing a fencing request to a hypervisor or management tool.  The following 
configuration blocks belong in the \fBbackends\fP section of fence_virtd.conf

.SS libvirt

The libvirt plugin is the simplest plugin.  It is used in environments where
routing fencing requests between multiple hosts is not required, for example
by a user running a cluster of virtual machines on a single desktop computer.

.TP
.B uri
.
the URI to use when connecting to libvirt.

.SS libvirt-qpid

The libvirt-qpid plugin acts as a QMF Console to the libvirt-qpid daemon in
order to route fencing requests over AMQP to the appropriate computer.  There
are currently no configuration options for libvirt-qpid.

.SS checkpoint

The checkpoint plugin uses CMAN, CPG, and OpenAIS checkpoints to track virtual
machines and route fencing requests to the appropriate computer.

.TP
.B uri
.
the URI to use when connecting to libvirt by the checkpoint plugin.

.TP
.B name_mode
.
The checkpoint plugin, in order to retain compatibility with fence_xvm,
stores virtual machines in a certain way in the OpenAIS checkpoints.  The
default was to use 'name' when using fence_xvm and fence_xvmd, and so this
is still the default.  However, it is strongly recommended to use 'uuid'
instead of 'name' in all cluster environments involving more than one
physical host in order to avoid the potential for name collisions.


.SH EXAMPLE

 fence_virtd {
  listener = "multicast";
  backend = "checkpoint";
 }

 # this is the listeners section

 listeners {
  multicast {
   key_file = "/etc/cluster/fence_xvm.key";
  }
 }

 backends {
  libvirt { 
   uri = "qemu:///system";
  }
 }
